Free and open-source internet censorship software. Claim your cyber sovereignty!

## Status

**Barely usable. Still in very early stage of development.**

### Roadmap (make issues if you want more)

- [x] HTTP/HTTPS filtering
- [ ] QUIC filtering
- [ ] DNS poisoning
- [ ] Blocking SSH
- [ ] Blocking WireGuard
- ...

## What

OpenGFW is an internet censorship toolkit implemented as a Linux netfilter kernel module. It aims to provide common features of the Great Firewall of China that can be deployed on your own Linux devices (e.g. OpenWrt router, Raspberry Pi).

Disclaimer: This project is NOT about circumventing censorship. It is the exact opposite - for applying censorship. Use at your own risk.

## How

Build & use instructions - TODO

## Why

To date, the open source community has not had a lightweight and user-friendly project that implements the features listed above and can be easily deployed on standard Linux boxes. Apart from the meme value, I do believe this project has practical use cases such as ad blocking, parental control, corporate network security, etc.
